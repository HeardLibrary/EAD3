- in the "src" subdirectory, the MS Word version of the Tag Library
- in the "TEI" subdirectory, the TEI files created from the MS Word version; the main file, whose name is "EAD3-TL-eng.xml", includes all the others which are in stored in the "eng" subdirectory
- in the "schemas" subdirectory, the RNG schema against which the TEI main file validates (and its documentation), and a smaller one called "tagLibrary_elementDesc.rng" that can be used to validate each of the files being in the "eng" directory.
