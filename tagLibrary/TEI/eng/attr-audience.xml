      <p>An attribute that helps control whether the information contained in the
                        element should be available to all viewers or only to repository staff.
                        Available for all elements except <gi>lb</gi> and <gi>colspec</gi>. The
                        attribute can be set to "external" in <gi>archdesc</gi> to allow access to
                        all the information about the materials being described in the finding aid,
                        but specific elements within <gi>archdesc</gi> can be set to "internal" to
                        reserve that information for repository access only. This feature is
                        intended to assist application software in restricting access to particular
                        information by explicitly identifying data that is potentially sensitive or
                        may otherwise have a limited audience. Special software capability may be
                        needed, however, to prevent the display or export of an element marked
                        "internal" when a whole finding aid is displayed in a networked
                        environment.</p>
