            <ead:p id="PRO123">In October 1964 the incoming Labour government created new office of Secretary of State for Economic Affairs (combined with First Secretary of State) and set up the Department of Economic Affairs under the Ministers of the Crown Act 1964 to carry primary responsibility for long term economic planning.</ead:p>
            <ead:p>Under the Act the posts of Economic Secretary to the Treasury and Secretary of State for Industry, Trade and Regional Development were abolished.</ead:p>
            <ead:p>George Brown was appointed as First Secretary of State and Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, and as chairman of the National Economic Development Council (NEDC).</ead:p>
            <ead:p>Composition of DEA: most of Treasury's National Economy Group (excluding the short term forecasting team); economic planning staff from the National Economic Development Office (NEDO); the regional policy divisions from the Board of Trade; a team of industrial experts.</ead:p>
            <ead:p>DEA charged with duty of formulating, with both sides of industry, a National Plan (published in September 1965), co-ordinating the work of other departments in implementing policies of economic growth, particularly in the fields of industry, the regions, and prices and incomes.</ead:p> . . . </ead:bioghist>
